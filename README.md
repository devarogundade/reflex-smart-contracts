# Project detail
## Name
Reflex Protocol

## About
Reflex allows you to mint and distribute DAO tokens, authorize wallets for voting, manage DAO treasures, create improvement proposals, and set governance parameters without writing a line of code. Parameters like token-based or multisig members governance, minimum voting token, vote approval threshold, early execution, meta transactions and more.

Leveraging the minimal transaction cost of æternity, and the underlying meta-transaction api, organizations can pay upfront gas fees for their dao members to participate in voting or creating proposals thereby guarantees smooth user on-boarding and members participation potential.

Reflex helps organizations to reward their DAO community and participants with non fungible tokens (NFTs). Organizations can then decides to give their reward NFTs a monetary value or including it in their products.

Treasury management on Reflex is a way Organizations can transparently fund or spend from their projects treasure allocation alongside with DAO members decision and approval.
